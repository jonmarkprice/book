# Comments

We strive to make our programs easy to understand, but sometimes, some extra
explanation is warranted. We can leave notes in our source code that the
compiler will ignore. These notes are called ‘comments’.

Here’s a comment:

```rust
// Hello, world.
```

Comments start with two slashes, and last until the end of the line. Larger
comments will need more lines:

```rust
// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
```

Comments can also go at the end of lines:

```rust
fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today.
}
```

But you’ll more often see them above:

```rust
fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today.
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
```

That’s all there is to it. Comments are not particularly complicated.

## Documentation comments

However, Rust has another kind of comment: a documentation comment. These
comments don’t affect the way that the code works, but they do work with Rust’s
tools. More specifically, the `rustdoc` tool that comes with Rust reads
documentation comments and produces HTML documentation from them.

Documentation comments use an extra slash:

```rust
/// The foo function doesn’t really do much.
fn foo() {
}

/// We also can use
/// multiple comments here too,
/// like we did before
fn bar() {
}
```

This comment would then be interpreted by `rustdoc` as documenting the thing
that follows it: `foo()` and `bar()`.

Because documentation comments have semantic meaning to `rustdoc`, the compiler
will pay attention to the placement of your documentation comments. For
example, a program with only this:

```rust,ignore
/// What am I documenting?
```

Will give a compiler error:

```text
src/main.rs:1:1: 1:27 error: expected item after doc comment
src/main.rs:1 /// What am I documenting?
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
